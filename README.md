This project aims to provide a 'Strava Wrapped' by allowing users to connect their strava and visualize their efforts for the current year. The recap displays total mileage, hours, elevation, and kudos for the current year. As well, the app shows a visualization of all of the routes the user participated in this year using polyline decoding.
The website was released in the last week of december in 2023 and saw over 5000 visitors over the course of a week.
